 Scrimba Weekly Web Dev Challenge - Budgeting Tool

 One of Scrimba's Weekly Web Dev Challenges. It's a tool to calculate if you have the budget to buy certain items. 
 
 The app allows the user to ener their budget, then enter the costs of up to 3 items. I've used JavaScript so that when the 'Give it to me straight!' button is clicked, it gets the values from each of the input boxes and stores them in their own variables. The item amounts are then added together.

 A message is then displayed which varies depending on whether the budget amount is >= or < the items total.

 The app also includes a toggle feature to switch from light mode to dark mode. This is done using JavaScript to add or remove various css classes when switching from one state to the other.
